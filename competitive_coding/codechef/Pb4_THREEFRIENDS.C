/*
There are three friends; let's call them A, B, C. They made the following statements:

A: "I have x Rupees more than B."
B: "I have y rupees more than C."
C: "I have z rupees more than A."

You do not know the exact values of x,y,z
. Instead, you are given their absolute values, i.e. X=|x|, Y=|y| and Z=|z|. Note that x, y, z may be negative; "having âˆ’r rupees more" is the same as "having r

rupees less".

Find out if there is some way to assign amounts of money to A, B, C such that all of their statements are true
